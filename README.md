    }
    response = requests.post(auth_url, data=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        access_token = response.json().get("access_token")
        print("Microsoft authenticated successfully")

                # Save document to backup folder
                with open(f"{backup_path}/{doc['name']}.docx", "wb") as file:
                    file.write(doc_response.content)
